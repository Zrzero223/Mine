    <p1>On the Jan. 19 Disturbed concert the crowd booed Draiman's mention of Taylor Swift on stage
        and were quickly reprimanded. The artist retorted, "Don't talk S*** about Taylor Swift.".
        He continued to sing her praises stating, "She is for real. And she's making sure that an
        entire generation of new music fans understand what it means to actually play music live." </p1>
